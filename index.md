## About Me

I am currently a first-year PhD student of [AI Thrust](https://ait.hkust-gz.edu.cn) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn).

I received my Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science and Technology (IEEE Honor
Class)** at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn) under the
supervision of Professor [Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net) in [John Hopcroft
Center for Computer Science](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn) of SJTU.

## Research Interests

My research goal is to build powerful and safe RL agents for complicated
real-world tasks. My current focus is on fine-tuning and inference of LLMs using
RL.
